The purupose of this webiste!
Too many times today in modern society is the voice and popular opinion of the general populous snuffed out by the over arching influence of money in our government and lack of political influence the average citizen has on his or her local, state, or federal government. Yes people can send letters, and vote for one day out of the year for their representatives. But in our modern world is this enough. Is this primitive form of democracy truly representative of the people’s will and the zeitgeist of the culture? I believe it is not, and we have lost our democorcray so here I have created a web site to help us get past this hurtle. You can now create an initiative and have people join them for minimum donation of 1$, where you decide who the money goes too, and the members of your iniative decide what percentage of the money goes where. I am tired of reading article after article of obvious corruption and greed in our government and media. I want change and I Want it now. SO start creating today and make a difference lets change the game, lets take our democracy back, let’s make a better world=D
